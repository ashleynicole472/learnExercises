***************BLOCK SCOPE****************

Variable scope means the section of code where a variable is visible.

// ./block-scope-experiment.js

var globalColor = 'red';

function colorGetter(){
  console.log(globalColor);
}

colorGetter();


*********EXAMPLES**********
//The classic for looking
for(var i=0;i <=5;i++){
  //console.log("hello".repeat(i))
}
console.log(i)<-- should not be able to run i since it is in the block function
logged 6
// i started off as 0, i looped until 5, the loop stopped at 5, then the console.log logged i becomes the 6th time it was call.


for(let i=0;i <=5;i++){
  //console.log("hello".repeat(i))
} //the console.log inside the {} will run but not outside of the function.
console.log(i)
// will not log this information since there is a let variable
Example again***
if(8 < 10){
  let x= "block scoped"
  console.log (x)
}else {
  var y = " global scope"
} // this will run but\/ the below console.log(x) will not run the x let since it is inside of the block function.
console.log (x)

Exmaple again **
if(8 < 10){
  let x= "block scoped"
  console.log (x)
}else {
  var y = " global scope"
  console.log(y)
} // this will run because both of the y variables are var
console.log (y)

var arr = ["test", "test1","test2"]
for (x in arr){
  console.log(arr[x] + " is cool")
}
****LOOK INTO THIS!! ****
hoisting - code school has a lession about hoisting LOOK IT UP. Concept that JS runs line by line but looks ahead at the whole program, and before it runs, it wants to know how much memory it needs to run before it runs.
before it runs, JS looks ahead, peeks at the vars in the program, hoists all the variables in the beginning of the program to make sure there is enough room to run all the variables within the program.

***Named function and how they are written
function named(){
  var x = 0
  return x;
}
myFunc()
// not running this function
// kind of function - is a named function
***Anonymous Function and how they are written (they get hoisted)
var anonymous = function(){
  var x = 1
  return x;
}
anonymous()

// *******Example of a const *******

var a = 10
var b = "23"
 a+ b will log "1023"

 const c= "5"
 a + c will log "105"

 a - c will log 5

 c = 5
// will log an error--> !!Attempted to assign to readonly property, because you can not reassign c to a different variable. Const are forever!!
const o = {key: "value"}
o
// logs
{key: "value"}
o.key
"value"
o.key = "newvalue"
o = ["stuff"]
// will log an error--> !!Attempted to assign to readonly property, because you can not reassign c to a different variable. Const are forever!!

********CLASSES*******
Have key: "value" paires
Can be used for real life world. Animals- mamals, repile Animal family Animal species.
Can be recreated with classes.
